<h1>What is Rubberocket? </h1>
<p>Simply put: Rubberocket.com is the website you're currently viewing!</p>
<h1>Why is Rubberocket?</h1>
<p>Rubberocket.com was created to archive and host Aleph Diallo's (that would be me) old and new projects. Whether it be horrendous Flash animations, Cartoon Network-esque drawings or even being out-of-touch with society, if it's attached to Aleph, it's here in some form.</p>
<h1>How is Rubberocket (made)?</h1>
<p>Rubberocket's code is mainly done on an early 2008 iMac with Windows 10 installed.
<br>Here's a list of software that's used to make the site, and not any of the content on it:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Macromedia Dreamweaver for coding</li>
<li>Macromedia Fireworks for a <em>LOT</em> of the site's graphics</li>
<li>Pale Moon to preview the site</li>
<li>Git to put everything out there</li>
</ul>
<br>The code for this site is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License, since people are probably going to copy and paste the source code from this site anyway. <a href="https://github.com/rubberocket/rubberocket.github.io" target="_blank">The GitHub repository can be found here</a>.</p>
<h1>When was Rubberocket launched?</h1>
<p>Rubberocket.com was  purchased on October 23rd, 2023, but the website didn't launch until 2 days later.</p>
<h1>Who is Rubberocket?</h1>
<p>Rubberocket is Aleph Diallo. As if it wasn't clear enough.</p>
<h1>Where is Rubberocket?</h1>
<p>Somewhere in New York. Server-wise, deep within the trenches called GitHub Pages. </p>
<h1>Will you show your face?</h1>
<p>I mean I did a self portrait so I might, I don't know</p>
