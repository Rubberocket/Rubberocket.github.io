		<h1>Steal his Tech! </h1>
		<h2>Hardware</h2>
		<h3>Computers</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="https://us.msi.com/Laptop/Thin-GF63-12UCX/Specification">MSI GF63 Thin 12UCX-814US</a> (2024-)
		    <ul>
		      <li>They're still new in stock online... I think... just look around for one. It's pretty easy.</li>
	          </ul>
		  </li>
          <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250101003717if_/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/https://support.apple.com/en-us/111924" target="_blank">2017 13'' MacBook Air</a>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Macbook-13-inch-Storage-English/dp/B0751N2Y78" target="_blank">Currently in stock from Platinum Deals.</a> Primarily used outside because the MSI laptop has subpar battery life. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
		  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529024352/http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-2-duo-2.4-20-inch-aluminum-early-2008-penryn-specs.html" target="_blank">2008 iMac MB323LL/A</a> (periodically used from time to time)
		    <ul>
		      <li>They're on eBay, just make sure it doesn't have a NVIDIA GPU. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/284425768193">As of 2024/12/31, this exact listing seems to be that of a refurbisher's, so maybe get that one.</a> </li>
	        </ul>
		  </li>
	      <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531131530/http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-2-duo-2.0-20-inch-aluminum-specs.html" target="_blank">Mid-2007 iMac MA876LL</a> (periodically used from time to time)
	        <ul>
	          <li>They're also easy to find on eBay for dirt cheap, but there's some pesky Early-2008 ones here and there so look closely.</li>
            </ul>
	      </li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Drawing Tablets</h3>
		<p>Most of these are still available for sale as of 2024/12/31, but for archival purposes I've used Wayback Machine links. </p>
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240118054503/https://www.huion.com/products/pen_tablet/Others/HS610.html" target="_blank">HUION HS610</a> (2024-)
		    <ul>
		      <li>Got it for the keydial. It's worth it, but if you don't need a keydial then you don't really need it.</li>
            </ul>
		  </li>
	      <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230911081027/https://www.huion.com/products/pen_tablet/Others/HS64.html" target="_blank">HUION HS64</a> (2020-2021, 2024-)
		    <ul>
		      <li>The first drawing tablet I ever got. I only really use it to bring outside or whatever, since it does the job really well. </li>
	        </ul>
		  </li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Software</h2>
		<h3>Art/Animation Software</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="https://www.krita.org" target="_blank">Krita</a>
		    <ul>
		      <li>No comment.  </li>
	        </ul>
		  </li>
	      <li><a href="https://ibispaint.com/product.jsp" target="_blank">ibisPaint</a><br>
	        <ul>
	          <li>My primary drawing/animation app of choice on mobile, just because nothing can match it when it comes to drawing on my phone. One thing I really hate about it is the leaderboard, there's no way to disable it and it gets in the way of people making art for fun. Really.</li>
            </ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>Microsoft Paint
	        <ul>
	          <li>I wish I were joking, but it's a pretty decent program to draw in. Unfortunately, layer support in the new version isn't the best right now, but it's there and it's really useful.</li>
            </ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>Adobe Illustrator CS5.1 (periodically)
	        <ul>
	          <li>MIGHT make the switch to an ancient version from the stone ages of the internet. Adobe <em>really</em> hates anything that doesn't rely on activation servers or a monthly subscription to use.</li>
            </ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 (periodically)
	        <ul>
	          <li>Like I said, might go older. Only time will tell. <br>
          </li>
            </ul>
	      </li>
	      <li><a href="https://boxy-svg.com/" target="_blank">Boxy SVG</a> (2022-2023)</li>
	      <li>Macromedia Flash 8.0 (now Adobe Animate)
	        <ul>
                <li>I don't use this as my main animation software of choice anymore, but it's there when I need it.</li>
                <li>Fun fact: I own this, along with the rest of the Macromedia Studio 8 suite, on an actual, legitimate disc. That's how much I love this thing. Really.</li>
	        </ul>
          </li>
	      <li>Adobe/Macromedia Fireworks
	        <ul>
                <li>Mainly for website graphics, since that's what it was built for.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Video Editing...</h3>
		<p>...which is something I barely do nowadays but whatever.	 </p>
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" target="_blank">Davinci Resolve</a></li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Programming</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>Macromedia Dreamweaver 8
		    <ul>
		      <li>Mainly for websites, like this one.</li>
	        </ul>
		  </li>
	      <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> (2024-)
	        <ul>
	          <li>The better notepad.exe </li>
            </ul>
	      </li>
		  <li><a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/" target="_blank">Nano</a> (periodically)
		    <ul>
		      <li>It's pretty good for coding. That's all. </li>
	        </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li>Macromedia Director 8.5
		    <ul>
		      <li>Plan to learn Lingo extensively to make crappy little games. </li>
	        </ul>
		  </li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Operating Systems </h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>Windows
		    <ul>
		      <li>Best OS aesthetically is Windows 2000. In terms of anything else the latest is the greatest... when debloated, otherwise anything before and including Windows 7 is pretty good... nothing amazing, though.</li>
            </ul>
		  </li>
          <li>MacOS (periodically on desktops)
            <ul>
              <li>It's OK, but it's not like I'm a huge Apple fanboy. I know what Apple does with its prices. And it isn't pretty... $1,000 for wheels...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
	      <li>Linux (periodically on older hardware)
	        <ul>
	          <li>Desktop Linux is a struggle to use daily for me, especially when it's not on anything ancient or anything that I have to get work done on. I mean, it's a good choice, but it's just not for me anymore. A debloated Windows install does all of the things Linux does, only better. I did install Gentoo on bare metal, though. Twice, even. It was a fine experience. Took too long to compile, though. </li>
            </ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
